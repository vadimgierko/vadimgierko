# Hello, World!

My name is Vadim Gierko and Iâ€™m
- a **self-taught React / ES6+ developer**
- with a 1.5 years of non-commercial programming experience
- & vast creative background.

I feel completely comfortable in front-end & working with Firebase as BaaS.

Learning to become a full-stack dev (MERN / Express).

Looking for the first dev job!

## What I love to develop

I'm insanely excited to build **complex React single page applications** & web sites, which:
- are integrated with **database & storage** (Firebase)
- support **users authentication**
- have all of **CRUD** operations
- have dynamic **router** (React Router)
- can fetch data from **API**
- are fully responsive (**RWD**)

My major projects:
- [Blogging Platform with Markdown Text Editor](https://vadimgierko.github.io/blogging-platform/)
- [Linky Notes](https://vadimgierko.github.io/linky-notes/), the app that allows you to create & organize notes with tags

## What I built

Check out my [PORTFOLIO](https://vadimgierko.github.io/frontend-developer-portfolio/) to see more of my newest public projects, try them in browser and/or see its code on GitHub.

## Currently learning

My current programming goal is to become a full-stack developer, so I'm learning how to work with:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Express App Generator
- Pug templating view engine
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- MongoDB Atlas
- Gatsby
- deploying on Heroku

I've built a basic CRUD MERN app already & now I'm diving into deeper areas of mentioned technologies.
