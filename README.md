## Future goals

### Full-stack JS Developer
My apps in [portfolio](https://vadimgierko.github.io/frontend-developer-portfolio/) are absolutely independent & (in some sense) full-stack apps (thank to Firebase connection), but...

I want to become a "real" full-stack JavaScript Developer, so I'm planning to learn:
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

### React Native Developer
I also want to develop mobile apps with React Native & Expo
