# Hello, World!

My name is Vadim Gierko and Iâ€™m
- a **self-taught React / JavaScript (ES6+) developer**
- with a 1.5 years of non-commercial programming experience
- & vast creative background.

I feel completely comfortable in creating & integrating front-end with Firebase as BaaS.

Looking for the first dev job!

## What I love & can develop

I'm insanely excited to build **complex React Single Page Applications** & web sites with following features:
- Firebase integration (**Realtime Database/ Firestore & Storage (for files)**)
- **Users Authentication** with Firebase
- all of **CRUD** operations
- dynamic **routing** (React Router)
- data fetching from **API**
- **RWD**

My major projects:
- [Blogging Platform with Markdown Text Editor](https://vadimgierko.github.io/blogging-platform/)
- [Linky Notes](https://vadimgierko.github.io/linky-notes/), the app that allows you to create & organize notes with tags
