- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vadimgierko
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m new to programming and interested in:
- visual thinking (sketchnoting and mindmapping),
- creative process management (wrote an ebook on the topic),
- learning and reading.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, but still working on side projects in HTML5/CSS3/ES6:
- 2D simple games,
- applications for begginers like survey forms, quizes etc.

The main goal is:
- learn cool stuff,
- build a portfolio of my projects here on GitHub
- and share it to the world!
