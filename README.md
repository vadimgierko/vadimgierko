# Hello, World!

My name is Vadim Gierko and Iâ€™m a **self-taught React / Firebase developer** with more than a year of non-commercial experience vast creative background.

You can check out my [PORTFOLIO](https://vadimgierko.github.io/frontend-developer-portfolio/) to see my newest public projects & try them in browser and/or see its code in GitHub repository.

You can also read about my programming journey in these articles (published on [blogging platform](https://vadimgierko.github.io/blogging-platform/) I've developed):

## What I love to develop

I'm insanely excited to build **complex, creative & full-stack React / Firebase single page applications** which support **users authentication** & all of **CRUD** features, like my latest:
- [Blogging Platform with Markdown Text Editor](https://vadimgierko.github.io/blogging-platform/)
- [Linky Notes](https://vadimgierko.github.io/linky-notes/), the app that allows you to create & organize notes with tags

I'm not a back-end developer, but I hope to become a full-stack in the future & using Firebase as BaaS gives me the opportunity to feel like one :satisfied: and build in fact full-stack apps.

## I develop my apps using
- [X] React 17.0
- [X] ES6+
- [X] React Router 5.2
- [X] Firebase 9.1
- [X] Bootstrap 5.1
- [X] Styled Components
- [X] CSS Flexbox & Grid Layouts
- [X] ~~Redux~~ React Context API & useReducer Redux-like state management pattern
- [X] Atomic Design methodology
- [X] VSC
- [X] GitHub & GitHub Pages

and of course
- [X] HTML + CSS + JS only if I need to:
  - do or test something really simple or...
  - use p5.js library for animations/ visualizations in cases like below:
    - simple 2D games, like [Old-school Racing Game](https://vadimgierko.github.io/old-school-2d-racing-game/)
    - simple 2D animation, like [Falling Snow](https://vadimgierko.github.io/let-it-snow/)
    - complex visual apps, like [Mind Map App](https://vadimgierko.github.io/MIND-MAP-APP/)

## Other interests & creative background

- visual thinking (sketchnoting and mindmapping)
- composing music (using GuitarPro 7.5)
- creative process management (I wrote an ebook & ran blog on the topic)
