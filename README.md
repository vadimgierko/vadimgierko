<h1 align="center">Hello, World!</h1>

<p align="center">My name is Vadim Gierko and I'm a person with a wide range of interests & vast creative background, who felt in love (to my surprise) with a full stack web development, which has become my biggest creative passion from the end of 2020.</p>

<h2 align="center">My life before I became a programmer...</h2>

Before I became a self-taught full stack web developer, I was doing a lot of stuff for long periods of time in my life:
- studying sociology, writing scientific articles on the topic & doing social research (2007-2014),
- learning, playing & teached classial guitar (2006-2015),
- composing instrumental music & songs with the lyrics (2005-present),
- doing a research about creative process management, running blog, publishing an ebook containing my theory & doing workshops on the topic (2016-2020),
- creating mind maps & visual notes (sketchnoting), sharing them via social media & doing workshops on the topic (2018-2020),
- reading a lot of books about self-development, time-management, creativity, productivity, psychology, biographies etc,
- working in local government institution & university (and additionally doing some creative work as a freelancer for a while).

<h2 align="center">How it began</h2>

Now, when you know, how many stuff I was doing professionally & for fun for so many years, you may be interested, why I made (such a hard in my case) decision and dived into completely unknown area (web development) and put this on top of all of my previous long-term projects and creative activities, which are frozen from the 17th of December 2020?

Basically, there was 5 main reasons:
- Influence of the Walter Isaacson’s Book “The Innovators”,
- Creative Process Management Reasearch (I wanted to discover if my theory of Creative Process Management, published in my ebook and on my prev blog, will apply also in web development),
- pure creative curiosity,
- a few web apps ideas I wanted to develop,
- the fact, that I could count on help & guidance from my good friend, who is a programmer.

You can read more details about mentioned reasons [here](https://vadimgierko.com/5-reasons-why-i-started-learning-programming).
