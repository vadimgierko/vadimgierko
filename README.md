# Hello, World!

My name is Vadim Gierko and Iâ€™m a **self-taught React / Firebase developer** with more than a year of non-commercial experience &... an artistic, writing, blogging & musical background.

You can check out my [PORTFOLIO](https://vadimgierko.github.io/frontend-developer-portfolio/) to see my newest public projects & try them in browser and/or see its code in GitHub repository.

You can also read about my programming journey in these articles (published on [blogging platform](https://vadimgierko.github.io/blogging-platform/) I've developed):

## What I love to develop

I'm insanely excited to build complex **SPA**s with **React** & **Firebase** (that's why I called myself a React/Firebase developer above :laughing:) with users authentication & all of CRUD features, like my latest:
- [Blogging Platform with Markdown Text Editor](https://vadimgierko.github.io/blogging-platform/)
- [Linky Notes](https://vadimgierko.github.io/linky-notes/), the app that allows you to create & organize notes with tags

I'm not a back-end developer, but I hope to become a full-stack in the future & using Firebase as BaaS gives me the opportunity to feel like one :satisfied: and build in fact full-stack apps.
