Hi there! My name is Vadim Gierko and Iâ€™m a self-taught programmer (front-end) based in Lublin (Poland).

In my projects I usually use:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- React
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- p5.js

My other interests are:

- visual thinking (sketchnoting and mindmapping)
- creative process management (I wrote an ebook on the topic)
- composing music (using GuitarPro 7.5)
- learning and reading
