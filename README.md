# Hello, World!

My name is Vadim Gierko and Iâ€™m a self-taught front-end developer with an artistic, writing, blogging and musical background.

Portfolio: https://vadimgierko.github.io/frontend-developer-portfolio/

In my projects I usually use:

- HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6)
- React (React Router, hooks (useState, useEffect), create-react-app)
- Bootstrap 5.1 & 4.6
- jQuery (when use vanilla JS and not React)
- p5.js (when need visualisations or animation, like in games or art apps)
- Firebase (database, storage & authorization)

My other interests are:

- visual thinking (sketchnoting and mindmapping)
- creative process management (I wrote an ebook & ran blog on the topic)
- composing music (using GuitarPro 7.5)
- self-development
- learning new things everyday
- reading annotated books
- sudoku, scrabble, chess, uno, blokus

Currently learning:
- Redux & Redux+React
